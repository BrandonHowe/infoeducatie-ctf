# The Room is Crowded

This is honestly infuriating. I tried 2 techniques:

- Keep track of the gaps, and find the smallest amount of consecutive gaps that can be pushed together to fit the team.
- Try to put the team in as many places as possible and find the smallest cost location.

Both of the times, my code became a blood-soaked hellscape. Well, this whole CTF is a blood-soaked hellscape. I spent 10 HOURS ON THIS.
