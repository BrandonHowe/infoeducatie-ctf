# Numerical sequence

This one was kind of sad. I came up with the coordinates idea as the first thing, but when I got a location in Myanmar, I dropped it. 

I then tried some stuff with patterns (made a whole spreadsheet with graphs, colors, etc), but didn't find anything.

Finally, seeing as 2 of the locations were in Romania, I figured the coordinates thing wasn't just a coincedence and tried it again. Guess what, that was the solution, and I wasted a lot of time!
