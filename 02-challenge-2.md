# Challenge 2

This one was also farily easy, though I was kind of stupid when getting the answer and took a while.

I figured that the bottom set of pictures were flag signals, so I looked up "flag signals". By coincedence, I actually found an image of the first set of images, but I was more concerned about the bottom set.

By using Wikipedia, I found the bottom set was sephamore signaling and deciphered it. The top set ended up being international maritime flags, so I just found an image and deciphered that. I put the two strings together to get the result.
